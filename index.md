## About

I am Nagarjuna Chidarala, an accomplished logic-driven analytics thinker and consultant with over 5 years of experience in spearheading data-driven solutions and insights. I'm currently pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics and Information Management from Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA, have an MBA focused on Business Analytics from NMIMS Mumbai, India, B.tech in Electronics and Communication from IIIT Sricity, India and honing my skills in statistical modeling, optimization, big data & cloud technologies, data science and machine learning.
<br><br>
As an Analytics Consultant, I spearheaded impactful projects in manufacturing optimization and operational efficiency for global Fortune 500 firms, identifying over $25M in cost savings. In a tech role, I developed SAS-based fraud detection systems for a health insurance firm, cutting claim review time from days to seconds and achieving 90% auto-approvals. Additionally, I optimized cash transit routes for a bank during an internship, resulting in a 50% reduction in nationwide operating costs.
<br><br>
In addition to my industry work, I have a passion for teaching and developing future analytics talent. I serve as a [Visiting Faculty at NMIMS Mumbai](https://online.nmims.edu/faculty/prof-nagarjuna-chidarala/), teaching graduate courses in Basics of Big Data and Business Analytics. Being able to impart my knowledge and experiences to shape the next generation of analytics professionals has been tremendously rewarding.
<br><br>
I thrive at the intersection of business strategy and data-driven insights. With robust technical skills, strong communication abilities, and a nimble learning mindset, I am eager to take on new challenges focused on advanced analytics, quantitative modeling, and communicating data narratives to influence strategic decisions in my next role.
<!--I am proud to have two awards instituted in my name: the "Rachit Shrachi Jain Full Attendance Award" for not taking a single leave in 13 years of school, and the "[Rachit Jain Award for All-Round Excellence](https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-school/delhi-school-events-new-era-public-holds-honours-ceremony/story-vjgvxNebhtel5KqC04KgBK.html)" for demonstrating immense dedication and perseverance with utmost humility. 
<br><br>
I believe in the importance of continuous learning and pushing the boundaries of knowledge for personal and professional growth. I envision myself to be a leader bringing tangible positive impact through my work in a future where data will rule and analytics will be mainstream.-->

## Projects

## Vehicle Routing and Optimization

<!--[Making Graphs Accessible - Creating Tabular Data from Graph Images](https://rachit-0032.github.io/hands-on-DL)
<br>-->
Implemented a cash-in-transit optimization project for a leading indian bank, utilizing **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) optimization** with Python and Google OR Tools. The pilot test in Mumbai resulted in a 50% reduction in operational costs, showcasing the impactful application of advanced optimization techniques. The success in Mumbai has paved the way for the nationwide implementation of this efficient routing strategy, promising substantial cost efficiencies and heightened operational effectiveness for the bank's cash-in-transit vehicle operations.

**Automated Categorization of Scanned Documents in a PDF docket**
<br>
Even in today's increasingly digitised world, many organisations still rely on manual verification of documents. While a manual check could be necessary for a authorisation stand-point, the process can be immensely assisted by using technology to categorize the documents in their particular categories as an initial, highly accurate, run which could be verified by a human. We (team of 2), as part of MIT MBAN Capstone Project, are using **multi-modal** text and vision based approach towards buidling a generalized capability that could support this work for **Wolters Kluwer**. 
<br>
I am currently working on this project...

## Optimisation

[Optimizing Inter-Hospital Patient Transfer (IHT) Routing](https://rachit-0032.github.io/Patient-Transfer-Optimization)
<br>
Inter-hospital patient transfers (IHTs) comprise about 3.5% of all hospital inpatient admissions across the globe. This project takes the perspective of a fictitious inter-hospital patient transfer company based in Boston, Massachusetts. The aim is to build a cost-effective ambulance routing system incorporating real-world constraints using **mixed-integer optimization methods**. A 46% reduction in fuel cost was achieved over a real-world baseline.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

[Named-Entity Recognition for the Astrophysics Literature](https://rachit-0032.github.io/WIESP-NER)
<br>
The number of scientific papers published per year has exploded in recent years. Indexing the article’s full-text in search engines helps discover and retrieve vital scientific information to continue building on the shoulders of giants, informing policy, and making evidence-based decisions. This project aims at using **Named Entity Recognition** (NER) to extract key information from scientific papers which can help search engines to better select and filter articles.

## Prescriptive Analytics

[Deriving Treatment Policies for Prostate Cancer Patients using Optimal Policy Trees](https://github.com/rachit-0032/Optimal-Treatment-Assignment/blob/main/reports/Submission/15095_Rachit_Moritz_Project_Report.pdf)
<br>
Prostate cancer is the cause of numerous deaths every year around the world. For this, and any other disease, there is always a need of improving drug prescription policies. This work aims to explore optimal, personalized prescriptions using **optimal policy trees** (OPT) for prostate cancer patients based on their individual characteristics.

## Reinforcement Learning (RL)

[Cooperative Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning for UAVs](https://rachit-0032.github.io/deeprl)
<br>
Autonomous vehicles are the future (and now even the present). Reinforcement learning is the backbone of such sytems where agents learn from their surrounding environments and make optimal decisions based on the rewards achieved. In multiple scenarios, multiple agents need to cooperative with proper communication, like for military drones. However, an enemy could potentially track these communication signals. This work judges the learnability of multiple agents in a more practical, **noise-enabled decentralised environment** with experiements involving differential privacy as well.
